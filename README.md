# Project Description: Tic Tac Toe (Xs and Os) 🎮
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid. The goal is to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

This Python-based Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play in the terminal. It features:

A simple command-line interface.

A turn-based system alternating between "X" and "O".

Input validation to prevent invalid moves.

A win-checking mechanism for rows, columns, and diagonals.
